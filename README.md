Swipe Page API Design:
Youâ€™ll need two main API endpoints:

GET /profiles-to-swipe:

Purpose: Fetch profiles for the user to swipe on (exclude users they've already swiped).
Input: UserID (e.g., Alice)
Output: List of potential profiles (excluding already-swiped users).
POST /swipe:

Purpose: Record a swipe action (like or dislike).
Input: SwipingUserID, SwipedUserID, SwipeAction (like or dislike)
Output: Success message, and optionally whether it's a match.
